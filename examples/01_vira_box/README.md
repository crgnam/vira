# Vira Box Example
This example demonstrates how to load an OBJ file with materials and render multiple image render passes.

## Rendering an Image
If you built Vira with the `-DVIRA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` option, then the `vira_box` executable will have already been built to your build directory.  Simply run that executable, while providing the path to the `vira_box.obj` file provided in the `assets/` subdirectory of this example.
