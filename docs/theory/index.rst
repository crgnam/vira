The purpose of this section of *Vira*'s documentation is to present the mathematics involved in the light transport theory.  This serves both as a useful place to developers to learn, as well as to document the more complex mathematical concepts that are used.

While `Physically Based Rendering (PBR) <https://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents>`__ textbook and repository are a fantastic resource, it can often feel cluttered with implementation specific details.  These notes aim to be a concise set of notes taken while developing *Vira*, and not necessarily as a learning tool in the same way as PBR.
