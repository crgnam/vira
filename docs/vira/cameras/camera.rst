Camera
===============================================

Comprehensive camera model for realistic image rendering and simulation. The camera class combines optical components (aperture, distortion, PSF), sensor characteristics (photosites, noise), and geometric projection to simulate physically-based image formation with spectral rendering, depth of field, and various sensor effects.
